    <p> This book focuses on the latest version of the language, popularly referred
to as <mark>HTML5</mark>. There are two other versions you might encounter.
These are HTML 4.01, the last major versions of the language from December 1999
and a stricter version from 2000 called XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup
Language). XHTML is still very popular in some applications so important
differences between it and <mark>HTML5</mark> will be called out in
the text. </p>
